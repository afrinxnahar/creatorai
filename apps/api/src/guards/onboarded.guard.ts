/**
 * Every credit-spending feature requires a trained AI *and* a connected YouTube
 * channel. This lived as a hand-written check inside subtitle and ideation only,
 * which is how dubbing and video-generation ended up chargeable by users who had
 * neither. Applying it as a guard makes the requirement declarative: a new route
 * either lists it in @UseGuards or it deliberately doesn't need it.
 *
 * Order matters — it must follow SupabaseAuthGuard, which is what sets request.user.
